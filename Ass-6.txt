Ass 6

Que 1 Let there be N workers and N jobs. Any worker can be assigned to perform any job, incurring some cost that may vary depending on the work-job assignment. Itis required to perform all jobs by assigning exactly one worker to each job and exactly one job to each agent in such a way that the total cost of the assignment isminimized. Write a Scilab program to solve this problem.


function [assignment, total_cost] = assignment_problem(cost_matrix)
    n = size(cost_matrix, 1);  // Number of workers and jobs
    assignment = zeros(1, n);  // Stores the assigned job for each worker
    total_cost = 0;            // Stores the total cost of the assignment

    // Create a copy of the cost matrix to avoid modifying the original
    cost_matrix_copy = cost_matrix;

    for i = 1:n
        // Find the minimum cost job for the current worker
        [min_cost, min_job] = min(cost_matrix_copy(i, :));
        assignment(i) = min_job;
        total_cost = total_cost + min_cost;

        // Mark the assigned job as unavailable for other workers
        cost_matrix_copy(:, min_job) = %inf;
    end
endfunction

// Example usage
cost_matrix = [10,20,30,40;
               40,50,60,70;
               50,60,70,80;
               60,70,80,90];

[assignment, total_cost] = assignment_problem(cost_matrix);

printf("Optimal Assignment:\n");
for i = 1:size(assignment, 2)
    printf("Worker %d is assigned to Job %d\n", i, assignment(i));
end

printf("\nTotal Cost: %d\n", total_cost);





output::

--> exec('/home/fymsc12/scilab_assignment/greedy_method.sci', -1)
Optimal Assignment:
Worker 1 is assigned to Job 1
Worker 2 is assigned to Job 2
Worker 3 is assigned to Job 3
Worker 4 is assigned to Job 4

Total Cost: 220
